Where Am I?
===========

Because my mother worries, and I find Google Latitude a bit stalk-y

Displays my location (currently based on last Foursquare checkin - set `FOURSQUARE_USER_ID` in the environment to control which user, and see the tail-end of `settings.py` for other Foursquare app settings, should you want to use this tool yourself)
